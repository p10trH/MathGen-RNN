# MathGen-RNN
This is a quick and dirty prototype to answer some of the curiosities we had when experimenting with word-rnn. 

We tried to "teach" a RNN basic addition, mostly to observe interesting patterns when sampling.

Mostly reused code from https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow by Sung Kim

...which is mostly reused code from https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow which was inspired from Andrej Karpathy's char-rnn.

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow](http://www.tensorflow.org)

# Basic Usage
To start the GUI and sample from a trained model.
```bash
python3 ui_genMath.py
```
The idea is to input a number (in this case up to 998), and a solution will be generated for that number. See the "Demo" section for a video showing the GUI.
